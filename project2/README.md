Project 2
============================

Shakespeare project for EECS 731

The goal of this project is to use classification models in order to determine what character is saying a given line from one of Shakespeare's plays. We will do this by analyzing a dataset of all the plays Shakespeare has written and utilizing different models - in this case, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest.
