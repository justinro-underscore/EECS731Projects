Things to keep in mind for project 3:

https://towardsdatascience.com/the-5-clustering-algorithms-data-scientists-need-to-know-a36d136ef68

Models:
- K-means
+ Specify # of groupings

- Expectation-Maximization
+ uses Gaussian Mixture Models
+ Specify # of groupings

- Mean-Shift

- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

- Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
+ It gives us all # of clusters from 1 to n

if using K-means:
"To figure out the number of classes to use, itâ€™s good to take a quick look at the data and try to identify any distinct groupings."
