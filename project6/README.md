Project 6
============================

Taxi Passenger Count Analysis Project for EECS 731

The goal of this project is to use anomaly detection models to identify changes in NYC taxi passenger counts over time. To do this, we will create Isolation Forest models and Local Outlier Factor models in order to try and identify the 5 given dates where NYC taxi passenger counts do not follow the typical cyclic pattern.
