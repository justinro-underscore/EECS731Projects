Project 7
============================

LA Metro Bike Share Visualization Project for EECS 731

In this project, I will use the LA Metro Bike Share dataset that I used in project 1 in order to extract more information on how to expand the program through visualizations of different aspects of the data. I will show the percentage of _trip route types_, _passholder types_, and _bike types_ used to try and find interesting points, and I will also show the percentage of _bike types_ out in public and compare that to the amount actually used. I will then plot how often bikes are used during the day, and what the typical _ride duration_ is. Finally, I will plot the bike stations on a map and show how often these are used, in order to figure out future expansion of the program.
