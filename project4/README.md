Project 4
============================

NBA project for EECS 731.

The goal of this project is to use regression models on NBA datasets in order to predict the score of a given team in any game. In order to this, I will play around with different models and features, and finally use Gradient Boosting with Opponent Points to achieve the highest accuracy.
