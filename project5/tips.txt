Do ten-fold verification
Fit 90% train 10% test then shift it so you still train 90% test 10% but on a different interval
For time-series, split data into 10 chunks:

|train|test |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|train      |test |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|train            |test |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|train                  |test |     |     |     |     |     |
|train                        |test |     |     |     |     |
.

|train                                                |test |

You can't do typical 10-fold verification because the rest of the data is the future
