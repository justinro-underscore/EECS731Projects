Project 5
============================

Product Demand Analysis Project for EECS 731

In this project, I will predict the future order demand of products using time series and regression models. To do this, I will do some feature engineering to make the data more suited to regression models, and also make the data into a monthly view rather than a daily view to test accuracy. Then I will attempt to predict the order demand of products with a low standard deviation of order demand and high volume of data points using Gradient Boosting and Linear Regression models. The results will be... less than ideal.
